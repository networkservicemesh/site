## Local development
This is the initial Network Service Mesh website. It was created using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

To quickly install Hugo, follow [this link](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

You will also need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).  Easy install instructions are [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

To run the site after cloning (with fast rendering disabled), run the following:

```
make serve
```
