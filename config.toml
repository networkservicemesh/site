The Hybrid/Multi-cloud IP Service Mesh"""

explanation = """
Network Service Mesh frees individual Kubernetes Pods to network with other workloads across multiple clusters/clouds using a simple set of APIs designed to facilitate attaching those Pods to zero or more "Network Services"
that provide exactly the

* Connectivity
* Security
* Observability

they need - independent of where they are running.
"""

usecases = """
Examples:

* A common flat vL3 domain allowing DBs running in multiple clusters/clouds/hybrid to communicate just with each other for DB replication
* A single L7 Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd/Consul/Kuma) connecting workloads running in multiple clusters/clouds/on-prem
* A single workload connecting to multiple L7 Service Meshes
* Workloads from multiple companies connecting to a single 'collaborative' Service Mesh for cross company interactions
