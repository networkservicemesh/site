NSM v1.4.0 is released via a set of [example use cases](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/release/v1.4.0).

## Kubernetes Compatibility
NSM v1.40 has been successfully [integration tested](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/runs/6242058138?check_suite_focus=true) with Kubernetes versions:

- v1.24.0
- v1.23.0
- v1.22.1
- v1.21.1
- v1.20.7
- v1.19.11
- v1.18.15

And also with [Calico CNI plugin](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/).



## Public Cloud Capability

NSM v1.4.0 has been tested on [GKE](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-gke/runs/6242555595?check_suite_focus=true), [AKS](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-aks/runs/6242058435?check_suite_focus=true), [EKS](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-aws/runs/6015597828?check_suite_focus=true), [Cross public clusters](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-interdomain-k8s/runs/6030822307?check_suite_focus=true)..

## Changes since v1.4.0

### Advanced Healing: condition healing on datapath to NSE being down

When notified that the control path path is broken, check that the datapath to the NSE is also unreachable before healing.
This will handle more robustly cases where there are temporary issues i the control path but the datapath is still
functioning normally, reducing the circumstances underwhich a heal will be triggered.

See at [Example](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/heal/dataplane-interrupt)


### Breaking up an application monolith with NSM

There are many existing applications in the world which consist of a collection of monolith servers. Most of user also want to be able to progressively break such monoliths up into cloud native apps bit by bit by pulling services out into Pods. 
Planned to add a new application that will allow for monolith servers work with required application from k8s via NSM protocols.

See at [Example](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith) 

### Update to Go 1.18

All NSM repositories based on go are updated to [go1.18](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18).

### Re-usuable workflows

Recently GitHub added a new [kind of workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) that can be reused from different repos. We added this feature for nsm/sdk repository. See at the [repository](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml)

### Advanced vl3 examples

We added more vl3 examples

- vl3 network recovery examples
    - [nscs death](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/heal/vl3-nscs-death)
    - [nses death](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/heal/vl3-nse-death)
- [vl3 network over floating interdomain](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/interdomain/usecases/FloatingVl3)

- [Scale vl3 network from zero](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/features/vl3-scale-from-zero)


### NSM+Application Service Mesh

We added NSM+Istio integration example via scale from zero pattern.

See at the [example](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/nsm_istio).


### Dual-stack examples

We added IPv4 and IPv6 [examples](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/features/dual-stack).



### Connecting a remote interface without creating a VLAN on top

In order to facilitate a wider range of virtual environments hosting the Kubernetes cluster it could be feasible to allow the injection an interface into the NSC without creating a vlan on top.]
