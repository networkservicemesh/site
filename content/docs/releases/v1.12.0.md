### Feature Request: Support configuration of NamespaceSelector



Auto registration creates a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` with no Namespace filters.
The mutation applies to all Namespaces.

The Webhook watching the system namespaces can create circular dependencies. Where system pods are required for Nodes to be made Ready to have the Webhook scheduled onto them.

We would like to configure this selector to exclude some Namespaces which should never be modified. 
For example we could configure the webhook to exclude the namespaces: `nsm-system` `kube-system` and `spire`.

Example of current webhook config:

```
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b
webhooks:
- admissionReviewVersions:
  - v1
  clientConfig:
    caBundle: <redacted>
    service:
      name: admission-webhook-svc
      namespace: nsm-system
      path: /mutate
      port: 443
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b.networkservicemesh.io
  namespaceSelector: {}
  objectSelector: {}
  reinvocationPolicy: Never
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
    resources:
    - pods
    scope: '*'
  - apiGroups:
    - apps
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
    resources:
    - deployments
    - statefulsets
    - daemonsets
    - replicasets
    scope: '*'
  sideEffects: None
  timeoutSeconds: 10
```

Example of desired webhook config:

```
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b
webhooks:
- admissionReviewVersions:

  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b.networkservicemesh.io
  namespaceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
      operator: NotIn

### Connectivity changes during runtime

Status: RESOLVED.

### Improve cronjob for CVEs scanning in docker images


1. Add image names in CVEs reports
2. Remove old results on every CVEs scanning
3. Fix the period of the cronjob


[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/10726)


### Describe how each component interacts with each other


For new users, it is unclear how NSM components interact with each other, or how NSM works as a whole.
For example, how the data packets sent by nsc are passed to nse through forwarder, so that users can have a clear understanding of nsm macroscopically

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/site/issues/262)


### TestRecvfd/TestRecvfdClosesSingleFile is unstable

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1525)


### Broken "cloud.google.com/go/compute/metadata" dependency

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1551)


### CVEs Scanner should merge the same CVEs

Currently, CVEs Scanner creates several entries for the same CVE if it's found in different images. The scanner should merge such entires into one and add all affected images into the entry's description.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/10810)


### Fix `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` issues from CVEs scanner

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/10770)


### [Bug] Connection event of the DELETE type is not sent after deletion connections with the Memif client

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsc-vpp/issues/629)


### alpine cant use curl with NSM dns

It looks like alpine:3.19's curl doesn't accept such DNS responses. I tried to manually change the DNS response from greeting.default.svc.cluster.local to greeting.default in ANSWER SECTION and curl (alpine:3.19) accepted that.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/11185)


### External NSC fix interface problem


Hi all, I was testing the example related to the configuration of an [external client](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith/external_nsc) to the cluster and noticed how the configuration of the MetalLB LoadBalancer needs to be changed.
In fact, in the [guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/loadbalancer/) offered by Kind, it is pointed out that the method through the ConfigMap is no longer supported.
One should run these commands

```
`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.7/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml`
```

```

kubectl wait --namespace metallb-system \
                --for=condition=ready pod \
                --selector=app=metallb \
                --timeout=90s
```
```
` kubectl apply -f https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/examples/loadbalancer/metallb-config.yaml`
```
I tried to open a pull request  to make noticed this, but it failed. 
I followed the instructions inside the example, but apparently the external docker fails to communicate with the service: in fact the 2 kernel interfaces that should be available, are not created. 
I don't know if it affects the order but this is what I followed:
LoadBalancer , via the commands provided above and offered by the guide;
[`DNS,`](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith/external_nsc/dns);
[External Docker](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith/external_nsc/docker);
[Spire](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/spire/single_cluster);
[SPIFFE](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith/external_nsc/spiffe_federation) ;
I then ran the [command](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith/external_nsc) to configure the cluster with the NSM resources, and finally the deployment for the [example](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/tree/main/examples/k8s_monolith/external_nsc/usecases/Kernel2IP2Kernel).

Do you have any hints for solving this problem?

### Add the ability to use a Spire certificate instead of an automatically generated one



Add the ability to use a spire as a source of certs instead of an automatically generated to improve security and safety of NSM webhook.
