### Update local spire binary in cmd Dockerfiles to support ARM docker testing

We are currently using `spire-v1.2.2` inside our docker containers (mostly for docker tests):
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsmgr/blob/main/Dockerfile

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9574)

VPP API requests hang until context deadline if we get `ping.WantPingFinishedEvents` after we made the request but before we get the response.

Example (Close request in cmd-nsc-vpp):
1. We make [WantPingFinishedEvents](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/blob/6f452c26d4133f75226866dedabce129eb84605f/pkg/tools/heal/liveness_check.go

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1589)


### Logging system problems



**1. Increase log file size** - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-tests/issues/2917
**2. Tests from different suites but with the same name overwrite each other.**
For example:
a. Run `TestBasicSuite/TestKernel2Kernel`
b. Save logs to `ns-kerenel2kernel`
c. Run `TestMemorySuite/TestKernel2Kernel`
d. `ns-kerenel2kernel` logs will be overwritten
**3. Logs are not complete.**
For example:
a. The last bash command from one of the healing test runs at
`time=2024-01-19T13:51:50Z level=info msg=1 TestRunHealSuite/TestRemote_nsmgr_remote_endpoint=exitCode`
b. But the last line in cmd-nsc logs is:
`Jan 19 13:50:39.017[37m [TRAC] [id:alpine-beef03a3-a58e-48a5-9100-d853c81da3de-0] `
More than 1 min missed

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-tests/issues/3420)

### [R&D] Add examples with using  VMWare Tanzu

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/11186)

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9644)


### Use Github CLI to create releases

### Add tag when pushing to main


Currently, we only tag images:
_ghcr.io/networkservicemesh/govpp/vpp:**v23.10-rc0-166-g4a6d39d90**_

It is also necessary to tag the commit from which this image was built.

### Refactor "parallel" package with passing excludedTests via Options

### Add dual stack support 

Currently vL3-endpoint only support single stack:
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nse-vl3-vpp/blob/main/main.go

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nse-vl3-vpp/issues/261)


### CI/CD: Sometimes release specific workflows are triggering on the main branches



Have a look at release workflow runs in cmd repos, for example:

https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsc/actions/workflows/release.yml
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nse-vl3-vpp/actions/workflows/release.yml

Release workflows are skipped for the main branches, and that's fine, but they also can be just ignored by CI. by release prefix as it is done in the deployments.-k8s repo: https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/actions/workflows/release.yaml (note: release workflow is running only on release branches)

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/issues/67)
