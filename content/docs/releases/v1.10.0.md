### Run all integration tests in parallel

Each integration test is launched in its own namespace. If we launch several tests simultaneously they won't interfere with each other. It will reduce time of testing on CI and also it will improve coverage and quality of the project.


**Results:**
| Suite | Old | New | Difference |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Basic Suite | 659.59s | 192.82s | 360.78 % |
| Feature Suite | 972.89s | 283.35s | 343.35 % |

### Missing arm64 Linux images

Add the possible to compile & run NSM on ARM based machines.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9215)


### Update go to v1.20.x



We need to update go to v1.20.x to solve issues with dependencies such like opentelemetry and also to have all benefits from latest go in NSM applications.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9216)


### Generate code for running commands manually

Currently gotestmd generates only automatic tests.
A test has requirements, the main body and a cleanup.
User is expected to run tests using `go test`.
There is no support to run custom commands without integrating them into the testing system.
Generated commands could be re-used in performance testing to keep performance testing up-to-date.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/gotestmd/issues/39)


### NSC - Add support for K8S PSS restricted/baseline profiles (for hostPath volumes)

K8S 1.25 release deprecates PSP (Pod security policy) and enables PSS (Pod Security Standards)/PSA (Pod Security Admission controller) by default. The PSS has 3 profiles - Privileged, Baseline and Restricted.
NSC requires hostPath volumes for unix sockets. HostPath volumes are not permitted in Baseline/Restricted profiles.

Need a solution for NSC to work in Baseline/Restricted profiles.

Couple of options:

- NSM CSI driver : Add a NSM CSI driver plugin to mount the hostPath volume.
- Use network sockets instead of unix sockets and eliminate the need for hostPath volume.

<!--- Try to give a general description (optional if it overlaps with the content from the Google Docs file) -->

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9218)


### Use counters instead of histogram for datapath metrics

Counters are more appropriate for NSM data-path metrics instead of histogram.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1464)


### Automatically sync-up NSM Site

NSM site is not up to date.

TODO: Consider Hugo modules, which would allow us to ‘import’ docs from repos into site.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/site/issues/251)


### Replace govpp from nsm vpp appss to nsm/govpp

In NSM it's super important to use latest patches or be able to quickly fix some issues in vpp. By this reason we need to start use govpp from nsm organization that improves control of the vpp components in the project.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/govpp/issues/2)


### Add a new example when one nsc connects to two nses with different services

Status: RESOLVED.

These runs have the same tag - `f316920`
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/actions/runs/5332639101/jobs/9662080619
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/actions/runs/5332638380/jobs/9662079089

It looks like we don't need `workflow_run:` section
