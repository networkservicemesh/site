## Changes since last release



### Run integration tests in parallel

We need to run the rest of integration tests in parallel

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-tests/issues/2862)


### Add LoadBalancer for vl3 networks

NSM vl3 could be perceived as alternative of k8s networks. Currently, k8s service is most useful thing in k8s network. 

At this moment, NSM vl3 network doesn't provide any alternative of k8s services. So we need to consider and implement the best solution for it.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9210)


### Automatically sync-up NSM Site

NSM site is not up to date.

TODO: Consider Hugo modules, which would allow us to ‘import’ docs from repos into site.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/site/issues/251)


### Update vpp version

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/govpp/issues/9)


### Add interdomain healing examples

Currently, we don't test healing over interdomain or floating interdomain. So we could add some examples of how to do that.

Scenarios:

- Forwarders death in floating interdomain scenario
- NSE death in floating interdomain scenario
- NSM systems death in floating interdomain scenario
- Proxy nsmgrs death in interdomain scenario
- NSMGRs death in interdomain scenario
- Registry death in interdomain scenario

We need to check scenarios from single cluster testing in multicluster scenarios.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9647)


### Add health checks for vpp based apps

We'd added datapath checks for kernel ifaces. https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-kernel/blob/main/pkg/kernel/tools/heal/liveness_check.go

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/issues/737)


## System stability fixes and improvements



### Update Spire version in Dockerfile for all cmd-repos


Update Spire version in Dockerfiles for all cmd-repos. Also add support for multi-arch build.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-template/issues/123)


### `begin` can't do `Unregister` requests without `Register` requests

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1515)


### Registry k8s can not correctly handle unregister when its scaled

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-k8s/issues/456)


### Parallel SDK testing

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1491)


### Add VPP config for ARM



Add vpp config for ARM. The config will be the same as in this PR - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/pull/905


[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/vpphelper/issues/1)


### Update all cmd-*-vpp repos that use edwarnicke/vpphelper

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/vpphelper/issues/4)


### No artifacts after CI run on public clusters

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-tests/issues/2874)


### `Update dependent repositories` workflow does update incorrectly

`integration-k8s-kind` re-uses [.github workflow](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-dependent-repositories-gomod.yaml)
This is wrong, because this workflow updates `integration-k8s-kind` instead of `integration-tests` in dependent repositories (public clusters).
For example:
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/actions/runs/5656999510/job/15325140836

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/issues/862)


###  How can i make composition of endpoints?

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9676)


### IPSec takes a lot of time on request

Our current implementation uses IKEv2 which requires an `rsa` key. 
The thing is the key generation takes about 3-5s - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/blob/main/pkg/networkservice/mechanisms/ipsec/common.go

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/issues/745)


### Routing between 2 containers 

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9864)


### AF_PACKET stopped receiving traffic

https://jira.fd.io/browse/VPP-2081
This issues is a continuation of this discussion - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/govpp/issues/9

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/issues/927)


### Feature Request: Allow configuration of initContainer resource requests and limits

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-admission-webhook-k8s/issues/292)


### MatchesMonitorScopeSelector helper function checks only one field

[MatchesMonitorScopeSelector](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/api/blob/main/pkg/api/networkservice/connection_helpers.go

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/api/issues/164)


### Add release automation for integration-k8s-${platform} repos

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-tests/issues/1667)


### Feature Request: Support configuration of NamespaceSelector



Auto registration creates a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` with no Namespace filters.
The mutation applies to all Namespaces.

The Webhook watching the system namespaces can create circular dependencies. Where system pods are required for Nodes to be made Ready to have the Webhook scheduled onto them.

We would like to configure this selector to exclude some Namespaces which should never be modified. 
For example we could configure the webhook to exclude the namespaces: `nsm-system` `kube-system` and `spire`.

Example of current webhook config:

```
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b
webhooks:
- admissionReviewVersions:
  - v1
  clientConfig:
    caBundle: <redacted>
    service:
      name: admission-webhook-svc
      namespace: nsm-system
      path: /mutate
      port: 443
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b.networkservicemesh.io
  namespaceSelector: {}
  objectSelector: {}
  reinvocationPolicy: Never
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
    resources:
    - pods
    scope: '*'
  - apiGroups:
    - apps
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
    resources:
    - deployments
    - statefulsets
    - daemonsets
    - replicasets
    scope: '*'
  sideEffects: None
  timeoutSeconds: 10
```

Example of desired webhook config:

```
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b
webhooks:
- admissionReviewVersions:
  - v1
  clientConfig:
    caBundle: <redacted>
    service:
      name: admission-webhook-svc
      namespace: nsm-system
      path: /mutate
      port: 443
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  name: nsm-admission-webhook-k8s-5dfd78487d-26n5b.networkservicemesh.io
  namespaceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
      operator: NotIn
      values:
      - nsm-system
      - kube-system

### Allow setting of registration url via env variable

Status: RESOLVED.

### "Permission tests" job runs even if there aren't tests require permission in the repo

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/issues/40)


### Log rotated after 5 minutes in NSMgr / Registry



To fix a possible increased latency due to logging in forwarder-vpp we could add a new chain element for min logging if current log level is not equal TRACE  

- Log input to server chain
 - Return from server chain
 - Output from client chain
 - Return to client chain
