Sub task of https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsmgr/issues/675

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1620)


### CI/CD: Sometimes release specific workflows are triggering on the main branches



Have a look at release workflow runs in cmd repos, for example:

https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsc/actions/workflows/release.yml
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nse-vl3-vpp/actions/workflows/release.yml

Release workflows are skipped for the main branches, and that's fine, but they also can be just ignored by CI. by release prefix as it is done in the deployments.-k8s repo: https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/actions/workflows/release.yaml (note: release workflow is running only on release branches)

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/issues/67)


### CI/CD: Replace github actions in `automerge` workflow with GitHub CLI

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/issues/71)


### CI/CD: Release based updates are not deleting after the merge

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/11430)

Related to https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsmgr/issues/675

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1622)


### grpcfd produces memory leaks

During using the grpcfd, we found goroutine leaks that could produce memory leaks in involved applications.
