# NSM Release v1.14.2 


NSM v1.14.2 has been tested on:
- [kind](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/actions?query=branch%3Arelease%2Fv1.14.2+)


## Changes since last release



## System stability fixes and improvements



### trace chain element consumes too many resources

`context.WithValue` is used in many places (especially in `trace` chain element). It makes `ctx` very heavy and significantly slows down some operations like `postpone` which are also used in many chain elements. As a result `forwarder` can spend several seconds only on `postone`.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/1667)


### `nsmgr` has memory leaks


After highload tests `nsmgr` consumes much more memory than expected. Memory and goroutine profiles doesn't show any leaks
