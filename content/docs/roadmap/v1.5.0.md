# NSM v1.5.0

## Release Schedule

- **Feature Freeze** -  2022-07-18
- **Release Candidate** -  2022-07-25
- **Release** -  2022-08-01

## Planned Enhancements


### Add support for VMs/Bare Metal external clients

Planned to develop an application to allow for non k8s clients to connect to NSM infrastructure from outside.

[More Details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nsc-simple-docker/issues/1)

### Public cluster testing via clusterctl

This makes our builds consistent and repeatable across a wide variety of infrastructure environments.

Planned to migrate next repos to the `clusterctl`

- integration-k8s-aws
- integration-k8s-gke
- integration-k8s-aks


### Distributed DNS over vl3 network

When vl3 NSE starts it creates a new DNS server that knowns each connected to that vl3 NSE network service mesh clients.
By default planned to use the next domain scheme: `{{ .workloadName }}.{{ .networkService}}.{{ .clusterName }}`.
The domain scheme planned to be configurable via `go-template`. If the DNS server doesn't know host then it fanouts the question to other vl3 NSE in the current vl3 network.


### Re-usable workflows

Recently, GitHub added a new [kind of workflow that can be reused from different repos](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows). Planned to add this into `sdk-.*`/`cmd-.*` NSM repositories.


### NSM+Application Service Mesh


Planned to add/consider next cases for meshes: Kuma, Linked, Istio, Consul:

- Run L7 mesh over vl3 network.
- Run L7 mesh as a service in NSM vl3 network (extension case).

That could simplify multi-cloud cases for the l7 service mesh and also could open new hybrid service mesh scenarios in the future.


### vl3 Improvements

Planned to improve next aspects for the vl3 networks:

- Use uniform MTU for whole vl3 network. [More Details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nse-vl3-vpp/issues/77)
- Shift vL3 to using one Network Service for connecting clients and a separate one for vL3 NSEs to interconnect with each other
- Shift vL3 to using ClusterProperty for NSCs to select their candidates (including with scale from zero).


### Webhook Improvements

Planned to improve NSM admission webhook and resolve tickets:

- [Consider support for 'kubectl annotate' operation](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-admission-webhook-k8s/issues/151)
- [Added support for all container-based k8s resources](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-admission-webhook-k8s/issues/150)
- [Add support for annotated namespaces](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-admission-webhook-k8s/issues/126)

### OPA integration for connection monitor and registries services

Planned to add OPA policies for connection monitoring and registries services.

See more details:
- [Integrate OPA with connection monitor service](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/46)
- [Integrate OPA with registry services](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/issues/269)

### Improve stability and bug fixes

Planned to resolve next issues:

- https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/issues/656
- https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk/pull/1312
- https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/issues/527

And all new stability issues that will be reported before the release!
